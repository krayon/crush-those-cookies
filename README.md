## Crush Those Cookies
This is an extension for Pale Moon web browser which crushes those cookies which are no longer desirable. It simply removes cookies coming from domains which are not bound with any opened documents after specified delay. By default this also includes third-party cookies created inside such documents. Cookie crushing is triggered on changes of domains in opened tabs and also on tabs and browser's windows close. Whitelist can be used to exclude domains, subdomains or basic wildcard domains from crushing cookies of their origin. The extension comes with a toolbar menu button providing quick access to some common actions.

### Building
Pack all files (except README.md and build.sh) from this directory into a ZIP archive with .xpi extension. Alternatively, while on Linux, make build.sh an executable via terminal with `chmod +x build.sh` and execute it with `./build.sh` to create the .xpi file.

### Usage
The latest installable release is always available at the [Pale Moon add-ons website](https://addons.palemoon.org/extensions/privacy-and-security/crush-those-cookies/). For a self-built .xpi file, just open it with Pale Moon to get it installed.

After installation the menu button should appear in the toolbar. All detailed preferences of the extension are accessible within Add-ons Manager page.

Example of manual domain whitelisting:
- adding __palemoon.&#8203;org__ to whitelisted domains will prevent removing cookies coming from palemoon.org
- adding __*.palemoon.org__ will prevent removing cookies coming from its subdomains like forum.palemoon.org or addons.palemoon.org
- adding __.palemoon.org__ will prevent removing cookies coming from both palemoon.org and its subdomains like forum.palemoon.org or addons.palemoon.org
